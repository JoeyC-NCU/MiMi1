LONDON — International aid agencies and governments mobilized on Sunday to respond to the earthquake in Nepal, saying they faced challenges in getting assistance to the country and distributing it amid the widespread devastation there.

In the aftermath of the disaster, which has killed more than 2,400 people, injured about 5,900 and left many more homeless, development workers said that continued aftershocks, a crippled transportation network and the loss of power in parts of the country had made it tough to search for survivors and distribute much-needed supplies.

Employees of aid groups have been affected themselves as they organize responses to the catastrophe. Sanjay Karki, the country director for Mercy Corps, an international aid organization, said that some members of his staff had lost their homes, and that although his own house was still standing, his extended family in Katmandu was camping outside until the aftershocks subsided.

“Every one or two hours we feel those big jolts,” Mr. Karki said. “We really don’t know what to expect so everyone is in a state of panic.”

The United States, India and China initiated relief efforts that were expected to send substantial numbers of foreign aid workers, search-and-rescue teams and medical equipment to the stricken country over the next couple of days.
